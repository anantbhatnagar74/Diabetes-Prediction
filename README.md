Diabetes can be defined as a long-lasting condition where the process of conversion of food to energy is affected, leading to an imbalance in the blood sugar levels in the body. It is caused by either the pancreas not making enough insulin or the body not adequately using the insulin produced. Insulin is a hormone that regulates the quantity of sugar in the blood.

Diabetes symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst, hunger, weariness, impaired eyesight, and poor wound healing. Diabetes, if not controlled, can cause major consequences such as heart disease, renal disease, nerve damage, and blindness. Diabetes is often diagnosed by blood sugar level testing. Diabetes treatment often consists of medicine, lifestyle adjustments such as diet and exercise, and blood sugar monitoring.

Machine learning algorithms may be used to analyse enormous volumes of data to detect trends and anticipate diabetic outcomes. This can assist healthcare providers in making better-informed decisions about illness diagnosis, treatment, and management.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a popular dataset used in various machine-learning projects for the prediction of diabetes.

The dataset contains 768 instances, each with eight attributes and one target variable. The attributes include skin thickness ( skin fold thickness), Glucose (Plasma glucose concentration), Age (in years) etc.

The target variable is a binary variable indicating whether or not the patient has diabetes. There are two kinds of values present in the target variable (Outcome), which indicate whether a person has diabetes or not.
